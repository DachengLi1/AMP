# AMP: Automatically Finding Model Parallel Strategies with Heterogeneity Awareness
This repository contains the official code for our NeurIPS 2022 paper: [AMP: Automatically Finding Model Parallel Strategies with Heterogeneity Awareness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07297.pdf). It introduces an **automatic** approach to find fast model-parallel strategies to train large Deep Learning models. We design AMP to tackle real-world scnerios where users are training **hetergeneous** models with uneven layers and **hetergeneous** cluster with mixed generations of GPUs. Concretely, it contributes (1) a valid representation space of model-parallelism strategies, (2) a cost model that can accurately predict the running time of a strategy without launching expensive real trials, and (3) a dynamic programming approach that efficiently optimize the strategy. ![Workflow](figures/workflow.pdf)
